# Long Covid in Singapore (WIP)

## Goals
1. Collate and present evidence based research about Long Covid, especially in a SG context
1. Enable others to help crowdsource and vet the materials presented
1. Become a resource to help educate and raise awareness on Long Covid

## Guidelines
1. Long Covid is not well understood or defined and can be controversial, hence the strong emphasis on evidence based research.
1. All research linked will be from reputable sources such as peer-reviewed medical journals, public health agencies or established medical websites. Preprinted research will be clearly :exclamation: labelled.
1. News articles and other web content linked must be supported by evidence based research. Where available, the research will also be linked.

# What is Long Covid?
COVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for months. The virus can damage the lungs, heart and brain, which increases the risk of long-term health problems.
