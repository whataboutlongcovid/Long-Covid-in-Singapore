# Long Covid in Singapore

## Goals
1. Collate and present evidence based research about Long Covid, especially in a SG context
1. Enable others to help crowdsource and vet the materials presented
1. Become a resource to help educate and raise awareness on Long Covid

## Guidelines
1. Long Covid is not well understood or defined and can be controversial, hence the strong emphasis on evidence based research.
1. All research linked will be from reputable sources such as peer-reviewed medical journals or established medical websites. Preprinted research will be clearly :exclamation: labelled.
1. News articles and other web content linked must be supported by evidence based research. Where available, the research will also be linked.

# General Stress vs Long Covid (Matched Cohort Study)
Source: Research Square, :exclamation: Preprint - https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-798316/v1  
**tl:dr** We describe post-COVID symptomatology in a national sample of 11-17-year-old children and young people (CYP) with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to test-negative controls.

Date of Study | Variant | Context | Sample Size | Reported Symptoms | % Reported Symptoms / Sample | Source
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Jan - Mar 2021 | ?? | UK, Students, Covid **Positive** | 3065 | 2038 | 66.5% 
Jan - Mar 2021 | ?? | UK, Students, Covid **Negative** | 3739 | 1993 | 53.3%  

:exclamation: Potentially oversimplistic conclusion: Taking the difference suggests a 66.5% - 53.3% = 13.2% Long Covid incidence rate
